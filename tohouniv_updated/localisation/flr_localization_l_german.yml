Turns out, this shrine was already abandoned long time ago and only another weird individual named Meira was found near it. During her questioning Meira mentioned a mysterious vanishing of shrine maiden from these lands. No matter how long Meira was searching for Hakurei power, she just couldn't find any clue how to obtain it. It seems we have to go look for the other 3 intruders, they surely may know something. We shall start with a vengeful spirit Mima. Also looking for Reimu's traces in nearby realms would be helpful."

She refused to cover any expenses whatsoever (unsurprisingly) but shared a fair amount of information. According to her, Reimu moved to a new shrine somewhere far away almost right after her return from Makai. Apart from it, Mima's beloved pupil Marisa didn't have any contact with her former master, pretty much like our Alice. There is only one person left, whose location we can confirm - Yuuka. An ominous flower lady living in a mansion called Mugenkan. Maybe she can clear things up regarding Reimu and Marisa?"

Though it seems its owner nowadays prefers to spend more of her time among sunflowers, they seem to be perfectly same person from before. Yuuka was a little surprised to meet our mistress under these circumstances and apparently she denied any accusations of plundering our realm. Still she did make remarks about people we are interested in. Wonderful shrine maiden of paradise Reimu, ordinary magician Marisa and even our Alice - seven-colored puppeteer, she seems to know locations of them all. Both Alice and Marisa live now deep in a Forest of Magic in their own realm, while the new Hakurei Shrine is located somewhere to the south. Though at first we need to travel through the human lands, where the local population may be quite unfriendly towards demons, youkai and alike. Also she mentioned a certain man Rinnosuke, which sells Alice and Marisa goods once in a while, he can be found in his shop "Kourindou"."

 MRY_the_other_side_of_the_mountain_desc:0 "Behind the Youkai Mountain Range there is an exclave of three goddesses in the Youkai Forest. The Aki sisters and Hina are deities for our rival religion.

We will show our superiority when we manage to get the judge of the dead to approve our ways!"

 MRY_religious_domination_title:0 "Religious Domination"
 MRY_religious_domination_desc:0 "Gensokyo and its faiths is ours! The heretic beliefs are shattered and about to see their wrong! Fro this day forward our religion will be the one deciding the fate of Gensokyo and in a way this of the world!"

 MRY_the_moriya_clergy_desc:0 "Unlike other realms in Gensokyo our clergy is represented by two groups within: the executive shrine maidens led by Sanae and the clergy ruled by Suwako and Kanako.

 MRY_human_world_title:0 "Convert the Humans"
 MRY_human_world_desc:0 "The goal of our conversions is not only to bring people to the true cause but also to gather their faith. And while youkais bring their fair amount of faith to Kanako, their contributions are peanuts compared to the faith humans bring. Sadly, the closest human settlings in our area serve hell and don't bring much faith. However, the humans from the Human Capital are a lot more profitable. It would be wise to conver these lost souls and collect their faith."
 mry_make_hmc_to_religious_tributary_tt:0 "If §Y[HMC.GetName]§! follows our religion, is independent and is below 200 development they will become our §YReligious Tributary§!.\nShould [HMC.GetName] have more than §Y200 development§!, §Yremain heretic§!, §Ynot exist§! or a §Ysubject§! our capital province will be developed instead."

 MRY_discover_europe_desc:0 "Even back in Japan they were just a myth - the Europeans from the far west with their uncivilized kingdoms and heathen beliefs.

 MRY_organize_kappa_inventors_title:0 "Organize the Kappas"
 MRY_organize_kappa_inventors_desc:0 "Kanako has great plans for Gensokyo and the life style on this land, but for this we need engineers, inventors and builders. Fortunately, our close neighbours, the kappas, are all this what we need. However, their skills truly shine as a team - which they cannot really organize by themselves.

 MRY_organize_influence_the_underworld_title:0 "Influence the Underworld"
 MRY_organize_influence_the_underworld_desc:0 "Goddess Kanako Yasaka has a vision to revolutionize the economy, society and technology of Gensokyo. For this she gave a hell bird once great power to develop a new way of gaining energy. However, due to the unpredictableness of the bird brain as well as the location of former hell, Kanako has no way to get the results of this project.\nIf we want to support her we will have to spread our influence in Former Hell one way or another."

 MRY_form_the_moriya_navy_desc:0 "The Hakurei Barrier has always been slightly broken - or else our realm wouldn't be in Gensokyo in the first place. But in recent times the cracks of the barrier have become far greater than ever before. It is obvious that the time of Gensokyan Isolation is over! We should build quickly a navy to be prepared for the outworld."
 MRY_establish_naval_supply_title:0 "Establish Naval Supply"
 MRY_establish_naval_supply_desc:0 "While having a fleet is great and all we are lacking in ports to really supply them. Fortunately, our heretic neighbours to the west may lack in faith, but they have a lot of of coastlines ready to become ours."

 MRY_beyond_the_barrier_desc:0 "The Hakurei Barrier is no more. Gensokyo is free to the Outworld. Many Gensokyan fear for the worst, but for us it means opportunities. Our ships should scout out the oceans to see how the current position and our place on this world look like."
 MRY_back_to_japan_title:0 "Back to Japan"
 MRY_back_to_japan_desc:0 "Japan is the land of our origin. It was these islands, where Kanako and Suwako fought with their kingdoms against eachother - the home of our Shrine Maiden Sanae Kochiya, a place of our heritage. Now it's a place of heretic Shintoism and civil wars with no ends. It is time for us to return and bring peace back to our ancient home."
 MRY_convert_japan_title:0 "Convert Japan"
 MRY_convert_japan_desc:0 "The history of Gensokyo is relatively young. Originally most of the inhabitants and even our religion are from our neighbour Japan, a country split in many small realms like ours. Much time has passed since then and the Japanese Shintoism and the Gensokyan Shintoism are now two completely different religions. Yet, if we show them the 'new' form of Shintoism, our Shintoism, they could save themself from their heresy."
 MRY_enlighten_korea_title:0 "Convert Korea"
 MRY_enlighten_korea_desc:0 "With the conversion of the heart of Japan our religious influence in Asia grew immensely. But we are not done yet! The Koreans follow the old way of Confucian, which has many old and useful traditions and mindsets, but it is also outdated. We need to help them so they can follow the way to fortune too!"
 MRY_challenge_the_dragon_title:0 "Challenge the Dragon"
 MRY_challenge_the_dragon_desc:0 "Confucian is an interesting religion: it promotes humanistic ideas and tolerance and it is filled with ancient traditions. But it can also become a danger for any realm, because of these ideas and tradition the state gets slowed down and can't make fast decisions. This problem is currently the cause of the Celestial Empire's fighting. They are slowed in their actions, yet they are still holding on their outdated mindsets. We should challenge them and save them from themselves!"
 MRY_shinto_unites_far_eastern_asia_title:0 "Unification Under One Religion"
 MRY_shinto_unites_far_eastern_asia_desc:0 "In the history of Asia, China, Korea and Japan have never had a good relation with each other and wars between these were more common than it should be. But with the unification of these countries under one, wholesome religion the conflicts may finally stop."

 flavor_mry.1.desc: "Higan, also known as Hell, is the seat of most powerfull goddess Hecatia Lapislazuli as well as the home of mighty yamas - the Judge of Gensokyo. Many humans think that Hakurei Clan, Senkai, Myouren Temple and what not are the hubs of religious authority in Gensokyo, but this is not true. As in the end they all have to answer in front of the Yamaxanadu, who is currently a follower of the Hakurei Faith.\nFortunately, our goddess Suwako has good contact with Eiki and could convince her to switch the official religion to ours."
 flavor_mry.1.a: "Sure. Let's give her a try."
 flavor_mry.1.b: "It's not worth it."
 flavor_mry.2.t: "Suwako visits the Yama"
 flavor_mry.2.desc: "While the [From.GetName] is our ally, their religious ambitions are quite ... high. Their goal is to enlighten all of Gensokyo to the right path of Shintoism. In the end, none of the religions are really important if a soul lands in Higan for their judgement.\nHowever, Goddess Suwako Moriya visited us personally and empathized on the political importance of our decision to convert to her religion."
 flavor_mry.2.a: "We will convert for her sake."

 flavor_mry.104.t: "Independence!"
 flavor_mry.104.desc: "[From.GetName] lost its way and changed the nature of their realm severely. They are no longer a desirable religious guidance for us! From now on we have to find our own path in this world!"

 HKR_build_shrine_prestige_title:0 "Restore Hakurei Prestige"
 HKR_build_shrine_prestige_desc:0 "With the break of the Hakurei Barrier as well as appearances of heretic religions, the Hakurei shrine maiden's authority has been questioned. Many people see Reimu as a lazy girl, who doesn't care for humanity's safety. Additionally, religious new-comer like Sanae, Byakuren and Miko are earning all the donations, which should be in Hakurei possession. To end this vicious cycle, we must show our capability and reliability-- at least on surface at the first step."

 HKR_religious_rivals_desc:0 "On the other side of the Youkai Mountain lives Sanae Kochiya, a outlandish and powerful colleague of Reimu.

 HKR_influence_human_capital_desc:0 "Human capital is the biggest city with most human population, and the biggest trade center of entire Gensokyo.

We must show them the necessity of going to shrine and open a direct smooth passage from human capital to our shrine."
 HKR_influence_human_capital_tt:0 "The reward is depending on how our relationship is with the owner of Human Capital. If we go the diplomatic way our reward will be more appealing for diplomacy while conquest / subjugation rewards us with military power.\n\nEvery non-[Root.Religion.GetName] province in §YHuman Capital§! or §YFarmlands§! owned by a [Root.Religion.GetName] country will be converted to §Y[Root.Religion.GetName]§!."

 HKR_warn_the_celestial_title:0 "Eliminate Tenshi!"
 HKR_warn_the_celestial_desc:0 "Tenshi Hinanawi is leading the celestial realm with Taoism faith just like Miko did with Senkai. Although far from main land Gensokyo, Tenshi has the tendency to cause a lot of serious troubles in Gensokyo - and she does this quite willingly to do so. We should make an example of her and reduce the threat she poses over Gensokyo!"
 HKR_back_to_the_past_title:0 "Back to the Past"
 HKR_back_to_the_past_desc:0 "Originally the Hakurei clan as well as Reimu Hakurei used to live in the northern part of Gensokyo. However, times have changed and the Clan moved to the more fertile and strategical important south so the ressources were assured for a reformation of the Hakurei Shinto with the Danmaku system. But some people from the north didn't like this decision and remained \"Hakurei Traditional\" - lead by Meira, an old challenger of Reimu. Meira claimed to become the next, better Hakurei miko. We should teach her that a Hakurei miko's authority is not easily claimed!"
 HKR_back_to_the_past_tt:0 "Every province owned by [Root.GetName] or its subjects in §YEastern§! and §YWestern Old Hakurei Shrine§! will §Glose§! all seperatism and autonomy and gain the §YCall to Arms for Reimu§! modifier for §Y20 years§!, which gives the following effects:\nLocal Manpower: §G25%§!\n"

 HKR_devil_from_the_past_desc:0 "We are back to the old Hakurei Shrine, a relict of old times. But now that we've returned we have to face the old neighbors too: Shinki, the powerful creator and goddess of Makai, has shown a great desire to increase her own status in Gensokyo. She tried to establish a new religion and to spread that to all Gensokyans. Although she is a goddess, we can't allow such actions. We have to shut her down and make sure no evil creature or mind will ever come out of Makai."

 HKR_train_a_miko_army_title:0 "Train the Miko Army"
 HKR_train_a_miko_army_desc:0 "While spellcards are still the norm of duels it won't protect a realm. Every country is building their very own army to compete for a higher status in Gensokyo. As the regulator of Gensokyo in name, we must build our own army now to make this name justified!"
 HKR_defeat_the_scarlet_devil_title:0 "Defeat the Scarlet Devil"
 HKR_defeat_the_scarlet_devil_desc:0 "Remilia Scarlet is a weird person - even for Gensokyan standards. While her nature as a vampire suggests only bad things for humans and our realm, her behaviour is in complete contrast to it as she rarely even interact with humans.\nStill, Remilia has the title of the \"Scarlet Devil\" and we heard that she plans on militarizing the fairies working for her. Because of these circumstances we should strike on her first."
 HKR_suppress_youkai_underground_title:0 "Suppress Former Hell"
 HKR_suppress_youkai_underground_desc:0 "The Former Hell, once a place where the evil souls atone for their sins, is now home of the banished, troubleseeking onis, the sinister satoris and other dangerous youkais. While the others residents are not threatening the balance of power in Gensokyo, the oni though might be different: rumors tell that they are gathering power to try to retake the Youkai Mountain - and eventually more from Gensokyo. And the satoris, who are supposed to control, them aren't much trustworthy either. We should take control over these threats ourself and cleanse heretics on the way."
 hkr_mission_to_not_hakurei_tt:0 "Every province in §YFormer Hell§! that is owned by a [Root.Religion.GetName] country but not itself [Root.Religion.GetName] will gain the §YShrine Maidens on Mission§! modifier for §Y20 years§!, which gives the following effects:\nLocal Missionary Maintenance Cost: §G-25.0%§!\nLocal Missionary Strength: §G+3.0%§!\nLocal Unrest: §G-3§!\n"

 HKR_demons_of_higan_desc:0 "Usually it is little to no business for the living of what is going on in Hell, but shrine maidens reported beast spirits leaving Hell and taking the living in Gensokyo! Of course Reimu reacted quickly and eliminated these spirits as well as challenged those, who unleashed them to the mortal world.\nHowever, the rulers - these who let these spirits free - still live on in the Animal Realm of Hell. If we want to make sure that there will be never again a threat from them we have subjugate their rulers."

 HKR_gather_allies_title:0 "Gather Allies"
 HKR_gather_allies_desc:0 "The times have changed in Gensokyo and every inhabitant of this once so peaceful land knows it. Youkais gather fairies and train them to soldiers, humans start praying to Gods of Wars and heresies are about to be created.\nWhile our shrines have competent defenders, they are no match against an overwhelming force during times of wars. We must ensure the survival of our [Root.GovernmentName] by gathering devout allies."

 HKR_great_power_title:0 "Gensokyo's Great Powers"
 HKR_great_power_desc:0 "It's obvious that some realms have more influence and power in Gensokyo than others. As our goal is to keep Gensokyo safe from outer and inner threats we must make sure that we belong to the great powers of Gensokyo or else any attempt to keep the religious unity and peace in Gensokyo will be doomed to fail."

 HKR_disciplined_shrine_maidens_desc:0 "[Root.GetName] is no [Root.GovernmentName] of war, but sometimes the religious safety of Gensokyo can only be achieved by the sword - like in the case with the Taoists. For this reason many of the young shrine maidens shall now undergo the same training and traditions as Reimu Hakurei, our devout ruling Shrine Maiden, did in the past to make sure that future wars will be easier than the one we had against the former crown prince."

 HKR_eliminate_the_fairies_desc:0 "Sunny Milk, Luna Child and Star Sapphire are the leaders of Sangetsusei - and the cuase for many, many costly pranks at the Hakurei Shrine. Reimu's donation box is already running low so having the three fairies causing more troubles than good is not beneficial to our economy. We should take them and the other fairies near them out to make sure that no \"prank\" will be ever played on us again."
 HKR_future_of_shinto_title:0 "Future of Shintoism"
 HKR_future_of_shinto_desc:0 "Hakurei Shintoism is an evolved denomination of the original Japanese Shintoism.

 HKR_the_gap_hag_threat_title:0 "Lady of the Borders"
 HKR_the_gap_hag_threat_desc:0 "Reimu Hakurei and Yukari Yakumo have a strange relationship: while they both serve Gensokyo by maintaining the Hakurei Barrier, they both have a lot of arguments and teasing. However, unlike Reimu, Yukari has a lot of potential to cause a lot of chaos not only in Gensokyo but also outside and due to her complex mind it's not easy to understand her schemes.\nIt would be beneficial for everyone when she and Reimu reform the Barrier Team again."
 HKR_future_of_hakurei_title:0 "Future of [Root.GetName]"
 HKR_future_of_hakurei_desc:0 "The [Root.GovernmentName] has overcome wars, incidents and the Donation Box Curse. But we shouldn't rest on the achievements of the past but making sure that the future of the Hakurei Realm is ensured!"

Reimu gives her the sake reluctant and after a while Suika becomes completely drunk...\nIn the next morning another chaos can be found at the shrine.

These are exciting news as never before was the Hakurei Shrine lead by somebody else than a human!\n\nUnlike Reimu, Suika is an oni, who honers strength, loyalty and honesty.

 flavor_hkr.10.desc: "Celestial are in general peaceful people, who enjoy a life without any worries in the heaven and tend to be quite humble. However, Tenshi is the big exception: she is regularly bored of Heaven and travels down to Gensokyo to cause chaos and destruction - just for her pure enjoyment.\nHowever, this finally found its end as Suika traveled to Heaven and had her fun with Tenshi. As a result of this many Gensokyans are more than happy that finally someone brought justice upon Tenshi."

The many preparations are made, the Curse of the Donation Box has been broken, the Heresy of Gensokyo has been eliminated and our [Root.GovernmentName] enjoys a time of tranquility and peace! Due to this, the gift was not surprising, but still overwhelming: the Hakurei God gave a portion of its power to Reimu Hakurei and granted her immortality! However, the job of a shrine maiden is tiring and Reimu could deserve retirement - but in the end it's her decision."

During this time a young female samurai called Meira challenged Reimu to an honarable duel. Reimu defeated her quite easily, but she developed certain ... feelings towards Meira and vice versa. However, due to the movement of the shrine and the Hakurei Reformation, the contact between those two broke up. Meira remained in the Old Hakurei Shrine to maintain the traditions while Reimu lives on in the South.\nBut now, that the Old Hakurei Shrine is reclaimed by Reimu, she and Meira had again contact - and with that the emotions might have been revived too..."

However, even as friends there are certain things, which brings rivalry in their friendship, especially when Incidents become a question. Even though they are friends, they always try to outdo eachother and prove themselves as more powerful. While this competition is friendly in nature, it could become one day a problem if one of the two girls starts preying on the other for glory. If [Root.GetName] strikes first Reimu could finally focus more on solving incidents quicker with Marisa's full support.\nHowever, their friendship has seen way worse and still remained..."
 flavor_hkr.17.a: "I should end this rivalry finally and get Marisa on my side."

 flavor_hkr.24.t: "Suika visits the Shrine!"
 flavor_hkr.24.desc: "When she heard that the Shrine got a special sake gift, she just couldn't resist. Suika Ibuki traveled quite a distance through Gensokyo to come back to the Hakurei Shrine just to get a taste for the special sake. However, Reimu still wasn't too happy with Suika's action the last time she was here, so for getting the sake Suika is tasked to repent in heaven and hell and come back a week later."

 th_incidents_mountainoffaith.400.desc.1: "Originally, Kanako expected a more ... explosive reaction to the moving of the Moriya Shrine from Japan to Gensokyo. But nobody really bothered with Sanae, Suwako or Kanako - even after the Moriya Shrine's influence over the kappas and tengus the rest of Gensokyo still isn't bothered.\nWhile just naturally waiting for the growth of influence would do the trick, it is just a lot less fun, so instead a shrine maiden apprentice gets sent to Reimu to close her shrine and accelerate the process."
 th_incidents_mountainoffaith.400.desc.2: "It was a normal autumn day in Gensokyo. A day like any other at the Hakurei shrine and Reimu enjoys the mild breeze in the air. However, this mood changed heavily as out of the sudden a shrine maiden apprentice approached the Hakurei shrine and demanded of Reimu to close the shrine.\nOf course this is not acceptable due to the shrine's duty to maintain the barrier, but the maiden didn't want to hear this and left."
 th_incidents_mountainoffaith.400.desc.3: "Despite to popular belief, our people enjoys the \"heresy\" the others call the Moriya Shintoism. But our numbers are low and we are surrounded by actual heretics, who would like to see ourselves be banished into the outworld.\nFortunately, our holiest place, the Moriya Shrine, has decided, that the time has come to enlighten more of the heretics and bring them to the right path!"
 th_incidents_mountainoffaith.400.desc.4: "It was a normal autumn day in Gensokyo and nothing worth mentioning was happening ... until rumors started reaching the ears of our people. Rumors of a new shrine in the West of Gensokyo, promising a better alternative to the Hakurei Shintoism. While a majority of our people likes to stay on the ways of [Root.Religion.GetName], others are quite fond of joining this \"Moriya Shinto Ways\".\nWhen the Hakurei Shrine got the message to close their shrine, it has become clear, that the time of religious tensions in Gensokyo has come..."

However, this time we have another story, why the newspaper came delayed: in recent times we Tengus had internal struggle with some newcomers and disputes about religions - the classic stuff.

But this is about to change! The new Moriya Shrine, right next to our humble newspaper production hub, has officially opened and started their campaign to get more followers! However, rumors have arrived that they also want to close Reimu's dearest shrine and eliminate so their only competition. HOW WILL THE SHRINE MAIDEN REIMU HAKUREI REACT TO THIS AND WILL GENSOKYO FALL INTO A RELIGIOUS TURMOIL? ONLY THE FUTURE MIGHT SHOW THE ANSWERS!"

But first some background story: you see, my shrine-\"\nS: *Sarcastic coughing*\nK: \"Excuse me. OUR shrine was originally located in the Outworld. And while we have lost faith as the humans were to busy murdering eachother, I have witnessed their technological progression and want to bring it to this lovely land of Gensokyo."\nBN: \"Aha. And what about your religious plans? We heard rumors that you two are trying to reform the Gensoykan Shintoism.\"\nS: \"It's actually only Kanako who wants to do this. Personally, I'm just here to see how all of her plans fall apart.\" *laughs*\n K: \"Supportive as ever, Suwako... Anyway, yes, the rumors are true. When we arrived here we saw an extremely wasteful style of Shintoism. All the good faith every god wishes to have just vanishes instead of going to the rightful deity and the main head of this religion doesn't seem to care. So for this we've decided to reform it!\"\nBN: \"I see. Well, sadly the time is over now. I thank you two for your time, Kanako and Suwako.\""

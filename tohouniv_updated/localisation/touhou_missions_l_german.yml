 HKR_control_over_the_tree_desc:0 "In the Netherwold lives a demonic cherry blossom tree, which attracts many people to their death. While it is sealed by the ghost princess Yuyoko herself it is still a great danger for everyone - and the fact that Yuyoko also has to rule over a realm doesn't help the seal. We should take control over this dangerous tree and reinforce the seals with Hakurei spells."

 HKR_convert_the_human_capital_desc:0 "The humans in the Human Capital, the heart of Gensokyo, are kindhearted, but they follow a heretic religion from old times. These Buddhistic minds stray them from the Gensokyan gods and corrupt even more people. We should stop this heresy immediately."

 HKR_stop_the_taoistic_heresy_desc:0 "In Gensokyo there's not only the Buddhistic heresy. In recent times a stranger from the ancient land Japan arrived in Gensokyo and converted the local population - only through her charismatic speakings - to the strange religion of Taoism.

 HKR_subjugate_sanae_desc:0 "Sanae, the shrine maiden of the Moriya Shrine, is a lovely person and a worthy rival.

 HKR_create_an_empire_title:0 "Create the Hakurei Empire"
 HKR_create_an_empire_desc:0 "Gensokyo was for the most part relatively peaceful. But the recent Breaking of the Barrier and the growth of heresy made Gensokyo a place of fighting and wars.

 HKR_convert_japan_title:0 "Convert Japan"
 HKR_convert_japan_desc:0 "The history of Gensokyo is relatively young. Originally most of the inhabitants and even our religion are from our neighbour Japan, a country split in many small realms like ours.

 HKR_challenge_the_dragon_title:0 "Challenge the Dragon"
 HKR_challenge_the_dragon_desc:0 "Confucian is an interesting religion: it promotes humanistic ideas and tolerance and it is filled with ancient traditions. But it can also become a danger for any realm, because of these ideas and tradition the state gets slowed down and can't make fast decisions. This problem is currently the cause of the Celestial Empire's fighting. They are slowed in their actions, yet they are still holding on their outdated mindsets. We should challenge them and save them from themselves!"

 HKR_shinto_unites_far_eastern_asia_desc:0 "In the history of Asia, China, Korea and Japan have never had a good relation with each other and wars between these were more common than it should be.

 HKR_expand_the_hakurei_barrier_desc:0 "The old Hakurei Barrier made of magic is lost forever. But this doesn't mean we have failed at our duty as protectors of Gensokyo.

 HKR_monopolize_trade_to_gensokyo_title:0 "Monopolize The Trade Flows to Gensokyo"
 HKR_monopolize_trade_to_gensokyo_desc:0 "The Breaking of the old Barrier isn't that bad: it allows now for interesting and profitable trading with the outer world. Yet, the foreign nations are still not trustworthy. If we monopolize every trade node which flows into Gensokyo we can better prepare for their possible plans of conquest. Ohh... and the profit we will make is nice too. Very nice."

 FOM_beyond_the_barrier_title:0 "Beyond the Barrier"
 FOM_beyond_the_barrier_desc:0 "The Hakurei Barrier is a great shield which protects the youkai from the Outside. But in recent times it has cracked and its influence over Gensokyo vanished slowly.

 FOM_discover_europe_title:0 "Discover Europe"
 FOM_discover_europe_desc:0 "The great magician Alice Margatroid once told us the origin of the witches: a continent called Europe in the far west.

 FOM_breach_to_the_lake_desc:0 "In the Misty Lake lies an island, which holds the infamous Scarlet Devil Mansion. The mansion has a huge library filled with magical tomes useful for our nation. However, some of those books are not easy to transport and won't survive a long flight. Due to this we need a direct acces to the lake - and the Fairy Lands would give this access perfectly."
 FOM_breach_to_the_lake.tooltip:0 "Own or have a subject own at least 2 provinces in the area of Northern or Southern Fairy Lands."
 FOM_annex_youkai_forest_title:0 "Expand the Forest"
 FOM_annex_youkai_forest_desc:0 "The Forest of Magic is the home of the witches and magicians of Gensokyo because of its many ingredients and protection.

 FOM_annex_youkai_forest.tooltip:0 "Own at least 3 provinces in Youkai Forest or Eastern Youkai Forest."
 FOM_expand_the_ingredient_sources_title:0 "Bamboo Forest"
 FOM_expand_the_ingredient_sources_desc:0 "The relations in Gensokyo has been tense recently and everyone is rallying an army. Our realm already has a decent doll army, but we need materials to maintain and to expand our doll army. The Bamboo Forest in the east has a huge amount of materials we need to create more dolls.

 FOM_get_full_access_to_voile_library_desc:0 "In the Scarlet Mansion there's a huge library full of magical tomes, books with ancient knowledge and even some forbidden writings. Usually Marisa could always 'borrow' some of these books but with the recent events everyone in Gensokyo became more tense and Marisa has lost her access to the library. Perhaps it is time to change our method: instead of borrowing the books we annex the library and with it the Scarlet Devil Mansion directly to our realm."
 FOM_rinnosukes_shop_title:0 "Rinnosuke's Shop"
 FOM_rinnosukes_shop_desc:0 "In the north next to the Human Capital there's Kourindou, or better known as the shop of Rinnosuke Morichika. Rinnosuke is an expert in identifying the true value of treasures we loot and pays us a good amount of money, but the people of the Human Capital started to isolate themselves, which makes trading with Rinnosuke difficult. If we however integrate his shop into our realm nobody can stop this profitable relationship."
 FOM_unite_gensokyos_humans_title:0 "Unite the Gensokyans"
 FOM_unite_gensokyos_humans_desc:0 "While some magicians are born as magical youkai, most of the witches and mages are or were humans, which means that our realm is bound to the Gensokyan humans. But Gensokyo houses many threats and it is a dangerous place for normal people. It is our duty to protect these people from all youkai dangers and integrate as many as possible into our glorious realm."
 FOM_establish_the_youkai_labrority_title:0 "Establish Youkai Laboratory"
 FOM_establish_the_youkai_labrority_desc:0 "With the additional ingredients from both the Youkai Forest and the Bamboo Forest and the knowledge from Scarlet Devil Mansion's library it may be now possible to brew a new Hourai Elixir. This Elixir has the ability to grant its consumer immortality, but it is lost and all knowledge about that were kept secret - until now. According to Eirin's notes and the books from the Voile Library the Elixir can only be brewed on a place where the air is extremely thin. One of these places is the Youkai Mountain in Gensokyo. We should establish a laboratory there."
 FOM_results_of_magic_and_technology_title:0 "Magic and Technology"
 FOM_results_of_magic_and_technology_desc:0 "The lab is finished, but the environment doesn't satisfy the requirements for the Elixir - even though it is the mountain with the thinnest air! Fortunately, there are people who could help us out: the Kappa in the west have advanced technology, which they use for incredible things like sucking air from the environment, but they're completely unorganized and until they find the machines we need we would've already died from age.\nAlternatively we can hijack the space vessel of Okazaki. Her technology is on par with those of the kappas, but she won't give it to us on her own. Either way, we need to take control over either realm and reorganize them for our purpose."
 FOM_train_the_doll_army_title:0 "Train the Doll Army"
 FOM_train_the_doll_army_desc:0 "The Forest of Magic is a giant forest area surrounded by all types of possible enemies: vampires from the lake, an ominous youkai hag in the south and crazed immortals in the east. If we want to survive we need to rally our army to defend this realm."

 FOM_eliminate_the_yuuka_threat_desc:0 "Yuuka Kazami, mistress over the Sunflower Plains, looks like a normal, nice woman, but she is one of the most powerful and dangerous beings on Gensokyo.

 FOM_overthrow_mima_title:0 "Ghosts from the Past"
 FOM_overthrow_mima_desc:0 "There is an ancient ghost in the north. This ghost is nobody but Mima herself, the teacher from many magicians and witches - her most well known apprentice was Marisa Kirisame. According to Marisa, Mima is... a difficult person and master, but her controversial teaching methods worked. However someday she disappeared without any reason, but now she is back and proclaims an \"empire\" on Gensokyo and has built a large undead army. It is unknown what her plan is nor if she is sane, but it is time now to banish this dangerous ghost back to the shadow realm."
 FOM_annex_makai_title:0 "Makai, the Magic Realm"
 FOM_annex_makai_desc:0 "Just like Marisa, Alice was trained by an ancient master of magic too. In her case the old goddess Shinki, master of Makai, was her teacher and, similar to Mima, Shinki used rather strict teaching methods. Now Shinki watches over her realm which contains dangerous miasma and raw magic.\nAlice grew up there under the care of Shinki. Years have passed since Alice left her old home of Makai, but she is still a legitimate Makaien and the closest relative to Shinki, which gives Alice a justified claim on the throne of Makai."
 FOM_stop_yukaris_shenanigans_title:0 "Yukari's Shenanigans"
 FOM_stop_yukaris_shenanigans_desc:0 "Yukari Yakumo is single handedly responsible for many incidents which happned in Gensokyo. Although it is just because of her Gensokyo exists in the first place, her shenanigans are still a threat to everyone. We should remind her that her job is protecting Gensokyo from the Outside threat and not to endanger it."
 FOM_take_control_over_the_shrine_title:0 "Control the Hakurei Shrine"
 FOM_take_control_over_the_shrine_desc:0 "The Hakurei Clan was always a close ally for us. While they guarded the religious and military safety of Gensokyo our realm grew. Now it is time for this Clan to hand their duties over to us and become a part of our mighty nation."
 FOM_create_an_empire_title:0 "Form the Magician Empire"
 FOM_create_an_empire_desc:0 "Gensokyo has changed. Since the destruction of the Hakurei Barrier and the exposing of Gensokyo to the Outside the relations between all the realms are more tense than ever and everyone seeks a victory over its neighbour. In these unstable times only the most adapted nation can withstand the test of time. Let us create an empire, which shall not only pass this test but also guarantee the safety of all magic wielders and humans of Gensokyo!"
 FOM_start_the_quest_title:0 "Hunt After Immortality"
 FOM_start_the_quest_desc:0 "With both threats from Yuuka and Yukari removed and with the establishment of the laboratory on Youkai Mountain we can finally start our research for immortality - and with the notes from the Bamboo Forest and the books from the Scarlet Devil Mansion it may be possible to create a new Hourai Elixir, the potion of immortality..."

 FOM_flask_from_the_tenno_desc:0 "To create a new Hourai Elixir we need the old, empty flask.

Luckily an old report from Japan implies that the flask may found its way to the Tenno in Kyoto. We should pay the Emperor a visit..."

 FOM_seouls_brewing_stand_desc:0 "In Eirin's notes it is written that she has lost her brewing stand on her way to Gensokyo. This brewing stand has the settings and tools which are required for the Hourai Elixir. It is also noted that she paid Seoul a visit before she arrived at Gensokyo. Perhaps her brewing stand is still there..."
 FOM_magical_gold_title:0 "Find the Magical Gold"
 FOM_magical_gold_desc:0 "According to the notes the Hourai Elixir needs Magical Gold as catalyst. While Magical Gold may exist on the moon here on the normal world it is nowhere to find. However some books from the Voile Library tells from legends of Chinese alchemists who observed special features of the gold from one of China's gold mines. This gold mine may be worth a look..."
 FOM_magical_silk_shell_title:0 "Anti-Magical Silk Shell"
 FOM_magical_silk_shell_desc:0 "The Hourai Elixir may contain by the moment of its creation way too much magic for a human body to handle. We have to find a way to weaken the magic potential of the potion. Eirin used for her potion moon silk, but you can't find this on earth - or at least we thought it. Rumours tell that a special silk from the Bengal Delta absorbs water, fire effects and even physical hits. It is probably a story told by some crazed guru, but you never know..."
 FOM_lunar_stone_first_half_title:0 "Acquire the Moon Sapphire"
 FOM_lunar_stone_first_half_desc:0 "In order to give the elixir the needed magical power two moon stones are required: the Moon Sapphire and Moon Ruby. Both got lost as Kaguya arrived on Earth and nobody remembers where they are now. According to Patchouli's tomes for magical items 2 strange stones appeared in Europe at the same time. The Europeans call them \"Philosopher Stones\". The blue Philosopher Stone is currently locked under the Notre Dame in Paris. Time for a church visit..."

 FOM_gilgameshs_plant_title:0 "Epic of Gilgamesh"
 FOM_gilgameshs_plant_desc:0 "Eirin's notes report besides the usual ingredients for a potion one special ingredient: an extremely rare herb in Mesopotania. The Epic of Gilgamesh tells from Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, and his story how he seeked out for this herb to achieve immortality too. Patchouli's version of the Epic even describes very clearly how and where we can find it. Where the legendary king failed shall we succeed... or did he achieve his goal after all?"
 FOM_greek_fire_title:0 "Recreate the Greek Fire"
 FOM_greek_fire_desc:0 "One final ingredient is a \"flame, so hot it burns even on water, so alive it will never be extinguished\". Obviously the fire represents the new life energy of its consumer, but the fire Eirin used is unknown. However old writings note that the Byzantine Empire used flames which resembles the Hourai Fire a lot. With a bit of luck our witches could find some old recipes for this Greek Fire in Constantinople."

 CRD_control_over_the_untrustworthy_youkai_desc:0 "Humans are simple and as such are no problem to read. They never get suspicious if we manipulate their mind.

They had once a great home in the Youkai Mountains, but as the tengu arrived the oni got expelled from their own mountain. The needs of our oni subjects aren't that important for us, but the tengu grew to be a serious threat for our security.

 CRD_form_the_komeiji_navy_desc:0 "A mighty army is great for expanding our realm, but without proper administration the new land won't be ours for long.

Yet we should still tame this dragon and claim their Mandate of Heaven for us, but to make this possible we need an entrance to their empire.

 CIN_defeat_kasha_desc:0 "The kasha Rin Kaenbyou is responsible for collecting all the corpses in Gensokyo.

 MHG_zashiki_espionage_desc:0 "You'll notice that we have diplomats to inform our neighbours what our goals are. But instaed of some boring, ancient men in awkward suits our diplomats are zashiki-warashis. These little, childlike youkais are excellent heralds and spies and because of their appearance nobody can be really mad at them. But I didn't use them for espionage missions for a long time and they may be a little rusty now. We should train there spy skills again... and I already know exactly who will be a good target."
 MHG_vassalize_reimu_title:0 "Subjugate Reimu"
 MHG_vassalize_reimu_desc:0 "The Hakruei Clan and I have a long history together. I created Gensokyo and the Hakurei Barrier (ok, of course I wasn't quite alone by its creation, but still) and the Hakurei dynasty swore to protect Gensokyo and the Barrier from all introducers. Well, the plot demands that this barrier is for whatever reason gone now and that the young shrine maiden wishes to repair it.\nReimu has the right idea, but without my help she will never be able to repair the barrier in this game. But she won't accept my help, which is why you have to show her our helpful ways by force."
 MHG_vassalize_marisa_title:0 "Subjugate Marisa, too"
 MHG_vassalize_marisa_desc:0 "Good job, human. We've got now one from two.\nAh, you're asking what I'm talking about, right? Reimu alone is powerful, but she needs her best friend on her side to be more motivated for her job.\nAlso having just one bodyguard feels awkward. Two is a better amount of bodyguards a beautiful youkai like me should have. Now then, would you capture the little witch for me now?"

 MHG_humilate_the_devil_desc:0 "To the west of our purple blob we find a scarlet blob. It is unsurprsingly the blob of our little, cute vampire girl. Remilia always liked to make a big fuss and even here in this game she makes things exciting.\nUsually I couldn't care less about her, I mean, I brought her to Gensokyo to start the Scarlet Incident in the first place. One or two incidents would make life more interesting here. Later I noticed this girl has some kind of rivalry with me though and she started to annoy me with her pesky Scarlet Mist.\nAfter the incident is solved we should pay her a little visit, little human."

 MHG_restore_the_hakurei_barrier_title:0 "Restoration of the Barrier"
 MHG_restore_the_hakurei_barrier_desc:0 "\"Restoration\" is not the right word though. In this strategy game a continent wide barrier cannot be really represented. To hell, it can't even represent the Great Wall of China properly.\n\nRegardless, to \"restore\" the barrier I want you to protect Gensokyo from any non-gensokyan introducers. Oh, and a lot of money, some good reputation, a little bit of prestige and one or two gifts from my outworld friends would be nice too."

Of course we could ask Aya to write our achivement in the newspaper, but I don't want to protrayed as the \"gap hag\" again... No, WE will tell them instead. Or rather YOU will, human.

 MHG_map_out_indochina_desc:0 "We have now a neat navy, but for some reason we can't use them past \"Terra Icognita\", although I already know all these locations. I guess I don't have full map vision because of balance reasons. Fortunately Chen is an adventures shikigami and can explore the sea for us. You should send her to Indochina first."

 MHG_settle_in_the_phillipines_desc:0 "Alright, now we should make our first small step outside of Gensokyo. I made some thoughts about how my blob should expand and I decided for a more \"peaceful\" way. Unfortunately, absolute peaceful is not possible here, but this shouldn't bother us too much.\nI like the idea of having a large, global trade empire while I leave Gensokyo mostly untouched. Of course you, the player and my partner in crime, could decide for another expansion way, but I prefer some good old colonization - started with the Phillipines."
 MHG_increase_influence_in_spice_trading_title:0 "Increase our influence!"
 MHG_increase_influence_in_spice_trading_desc:0 "So, we have now good foothold on the Phillipines. This should allow you to make our next step easier. You see, in this game there's no proper Sphere of Influence which would be more fitting for me. But that doesn't mean we cannot radiate any influence at all - for example through trade. I want you to spread the influence of my realm in the rich areas of the spice islands. I don't care how. You can conquer this puny humans, colonize the empty provinces or send so much more boats than the British Empire ever had in its entire existance."
 MHG_found_the_yakumo_embassy_title:0 "Mayohiga Embassy"
 MHG_found_the_yakumo_embassy_desc:0 "You know what? We could use a beautiful embassy. Our country is exploring and expanding into the outworld and while doing this we will encounter foreign, rich nations. An embassy would not only be usefull for diplomacy but it also would make our capital to an important trading city. But to realize such a project we will need some internal stability or else the fairies will never be finished with the building.\n\nAnd no, I won't burrow a large building and make this to an embassy.

For me at least they are funny. I mean they actively wage wars so they can capture as many humans as possible to sacrifice them to their gods.\nWhat's the matter? Aren't you appealed of human hunting so you have some sacrifices? You know what? I think we could make their sacrifices a little bit more meaningfull if we subjugate this pesky empire and force them the gensokyan faith, so if they kill some people they will at least do it in my name. So let's get started with the conquest..."

 MHG_meet_the_pagan_gods_desc:0 "Ok, I will tell you the truth: there's a special reason why I gave you the task of aztec subjugation - and it isn't my love for human sacrifices. I wanted to drive an old friend out of his hiding place. And by force converting and subjugation of his followers I annoyed him enough to get his attention. It's now time to meet him..."

I don't know nor do I care what her plan is. Important is to bring her AND her silk back.\nSpeaking of which: I want her moon silk, because it isn't your usual fabric. It is an alien material, which doesn't exist outside this game, but it has the ability to create gaps and is highly anti-magical. This thing prevents me from using my gaps to find and get this girl myself.\n\nFortunately my contact told me of three possible hideouts. It's time to hunt a lunarian down..."

This is why I helped her.)\nRegardless, she was very thankful for this and promised if there should be no legitimate pharaoh I should get the egyptian throne.\nBut I never got the opportunity to claim the throne because... weeell, she and her roman lover got a child (who was illegitimate, but whatever).

A lot of intelligent and strong men tried to solve this Knot, but nobody was able to do so. Well... except for one: Alexander. As he stood before this knot he draw his sword and cut the knot in half.\n\"But what has this to do with you?\" you may ask. You see, this oracle was a youkai, who made with me a bet that no human would solve it.

Well, if you would take a look at the ideas of our lovely blob you can see that we are quite mercenaries focused. But did you ever question, where these mercs are coming from? And here comes our grey blob in play: I hire prussian soldiers and teleport them to our country, so they can serve us (ignore their description as \"Fairy\", this is just show). In return Prussia gains militaristic experience and some well earned money.\nNow to our problem: the teleportation via my gap is intense for the soldiers and they lose a good part of sanity (if you finished the Aztecs mission you will know what I mean) resulting them being less disciplinated than your usual Prussian. However, if I have Prussia as my puppet the teleportation won't be that necessary and they could focus more on fight - well, until I am to inpatient for the soldiers."

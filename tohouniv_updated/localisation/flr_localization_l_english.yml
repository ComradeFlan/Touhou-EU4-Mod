Turns out, this shrine was already abandoned long time ago and only another weird individual named Meira was found near it. During her questioning Meira mentioned a mysterious vanishing of shrine maiden from these lands. No matter how long Meira was searching for Hakurei power, she just couldn't find any clue how to obtain it. It seems we have to go look for the other 3 intruders, they surely may know something. We shall start with a vengeful spirit Mima. Also looking for Reimu's traces in nearby realms would be helpful."

She refused to cover any expenses whatsoever (unsurprisingly) but shared a fair amount of information. According to her, Reimu moved to a new shrine somewhere far away almost right after her return from Makai. Apart from it, Mima's beloved pupil Marisa didn't have any contact with her former master, pretty much like our Alice. There is only one person left, whose location we can confirm - Yuuka.

Still she did make remarks about people we are interested in. Wonderful shrine maiden of paradise Reimu, ordinary magician Marisa and even our Alice - seven-colored puppeteer, she seems to know locations of them all. Both Alice and Marisa live now deep in a Forest of Magic in their own realm, while the new Hakurei Shrine is located somewhere to the south. Though at first we need to travel through the human lands, where the local population may be quite unfriendly towards demons, youkai and alike.

And while youkais bring their fair amount of faith to Kanako, their contributions are peanuts compared to the faith humans bring. Sadly, the closest human settlings in our area serve hell and don't bring much faith. However, the humans from the Human Capital are a lot more profitable.

 MRY_convert_japan_title:0 "Convert Japan"
 MRY_convert_japan_desc:0 "The history of Gensokyo is relatively young. Originally most of the inhabitants and even our religion are from our neighbour Japan, a country split in many small realms like ours. Much time has passed since then and the Japanese Shintoism and the Gensokyan Shintoism are now two completely different religions. Yet, if we show them the 'new' form of Shintoism, our Shintoism, they could save themself from their heresy."
 MRY_enlighten_korea_title:0 "Convert Korea"
 MRY_enlighten_korea_desc:0 "With the conversion of the heart of Japan our religious influence in Asia grew immensely. But we are not done yet!

But it can also become a danger for any realm, because of these ideas and tradition the state gets slowed down and can't make fast decisions. This problem is currently the cause of the Celestial Empire's fighting. They are slowed in their actions, yet they are still holding on their outdated mindsets.

But nobody really bothered with Sanae, Suwako or Kanako - even after the Moriya Shrine's influence over the kappas and tengus the rest of Gensokyo still isn't bothered.\nWhile just naturally waiting for the growth of influence would do the trick, it is just a lot less fun, so instead a shrine maiden apprentice gets sent to Reimu to close her shrine and accelerate the process."
 th_incidents_mountainoffaith.400.desc.2: "It was a normal autumn day in Gensokyo. A day like any other at the Hakurei shrine and Reimu enjoys the mild breeze in the air. However, this mood changed heavily as out of the sudden a shrine maiden apprentice approached the Hakurei shrine and demanded of Reimu to close the shrine.\nOf course this is not acceptable due to the shrine's duty to maintain the barrier, but the maiden didn't want to hear this and left."

While a majority of our people likes to stay on the ways of [Root.Religion.GetName], others are quite fond of joining this \"Moriya Shinto Ways\".\nWhen the Hakurei Shrine got the message to close their shrine, it has become clear, that the time of religious tensions in Gensokyo has come..."

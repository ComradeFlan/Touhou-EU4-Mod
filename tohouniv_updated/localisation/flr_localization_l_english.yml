 flavor_flr.1.desc: "Mistress Remilia's sister, Flandre has been living in a basement for long year. Over time, she became nostalgic for the outside world, especially for the old European land where she spent her childhood, and wanted to rule land and army like her sister. Of course, her sister didn't think to listen to this request.\nOne day, a purple beauty suddenly appeared in a tightly locked basement. She said she would take Flandre to her homeland in Europe, and give her a chance to rule the small country there if she wanted to. How should she respond to this welcome but sudden suggestion? The choice is up to 'you'..."

 flavor_flr.2.desc: "Our army and people rose up to fight against the oppressors, but because of the lack of military experience, there is no commander worthy of command. mistress Flandre saw this situation and sent a mana-made clone to lead our army.

Our mistress has shown her fighting with the army herself(though most of them don't know it's a Clone), which has neutralized the most important basis of this law! Thanks to the our presence on empire and help of elector who rely on her, our mistress has qualified herself to run for the Emperor's election!"

 flavor_flr.5.t: "Transfer Electorate?"
 flavor_flr.5.desc: "We may be able to make use of Brandenburg's military as well as their Electorate status. We can ask the Emperor to hand over their Electorate post to us. Of course, it's going to cost enough..."

 flavor_flr.5.b: "Is that really necessary?"
 flavor_flr.51.t: "Transfer the Brandenburg Electorate to Flandre?"
 flavor_flr.51.desc: "A letter from Flandre, who took control of Brandenburg, has sent us. They are demanding that Brandenburg hand over Electorate's right to them! It's unprecedented, but it's inevitable that they'll have eyes on the gifts they brought with them..."
 flavor_flr.51.a: "Long live the Elector of [From.GetUsableName]!"
 flavor_flr.51.a2: "Let it be done."
 flavor_flr.51.b: "The Electorate shall remain with the Brandenburg."

 flavor_flr.61.t: "A wise choice"
 flavor_flr.61.desc: "Your sister wisely accepted your offer. Now not only Europe but also gensokyo will receive your fair rule, my kaiserin!"
 flavor_flr.61.a: "That's what I wanted!"
 flavor_flr.62.t: "The Board is broken"
 flavor_flr.62.desc: "foolishly, your sister rejected your offer! If she refuses to make a wise decision on the pretext of pride until the end, you will have no choice but to teach her yourself, my kaiserin!"

 flavor_flr.7.t: "An unsentable letter"
 flavor_flr.7.desc: "Poor thing, the realm your sister ruled has already disappeared. The komeiji family, our long-time rival, has taken over your another home! Now that they have taken the land of your family, it is now their turn to take it again, my kaiserin!"

 flavor_flr.8.t: "The Kaiserin sparks a Fashion Craze"
 flavor_flr.8.desc: "As a candidate for the Holy Roman crown, Countess Flandre Scarlet boasted near-universal support among the prince-electors. This popularity manifested in their votes - and now, in their spending habits. Across the Empire nobles minor and powerful have taken to emulating the new Empress' appearance, adopting her bright blood-colored dresses and comfortable choices in hattery and seeking out cut gems imitative of her distinct multicolored wings. Merchants in Europe have increased their imports of dyes, jewels, and fine cloth in response, hoping to capitalize on the German fashion craze as long as it lasts; flattery may be feigned, but gold is very, very real."
 flavor_flr.8.a: "Nicht die Schönheit entscheidet wen wir lieben-"
 flavor_flr.8.b: "sondern die Liebe entscheidet wen wir schön finden."
 flavor_flr.9.t: "Return to the Gensokyan faith?"

However, when Flandre got the opportunity to start her own path to glory in Europe she had to change her official religion to Catholic.\nBut now that we have established a considerable power base in Europe as well contact with Gensokyo yet again, Reimu Hakurei is making us an offer to return to the Gensokyan faith. How shall our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] react?"
 flavor_flr.9.a: "The belief of our realm was always Gensokyan at heart. It is time to return to it."

 MKI_break_the_barrier_title:0 "Reach the Outworld"
 MKI_break_the_barrier_desc:0 "According to our tourists' reports, behind the Gate to Makai lies Gensokyo. But not just that, it seems even this huge piece of land is only a fraction of the outside world. Tourists say that up until recently it was separated by another barrier - the Great Hakurei Border, which is now gone for good. We should exploit this possibility to go and look for even more new lands!"
 MKI_discover_europe_title:0 "Discover Europe"
 MKI_discover_europe_desc:0 "Outside world sure is a huge mystery for us. According to various questionable rumours circulating recently, there is a remote continent called... I believe it was "Europe" or something? Little is known to us, some tourists even doubt its existence. Whatever the case, we have to explore the uncharted waters and find the truth for ourselves!"

During her questioning Meira mentioned a mysterious vanishing of shrine maiden from these lands. No matter how long Meira was searching for Hakurei power, she just couldn't find any clue how to obtain it. It seems we have to go look for the other 3 intruders, they surely may know something. We shall start with a vengeful spirit Mima. Also looking for Reimu's traces in nearby realms would be helpful."

She refused to cover any expenses whatsoever (unsurprisingly) but shared a fair amount of information. According to her, Reimu moved to a new shrine somewhere far away almost right after her return from Makai. Apart from it, Mima's beloved pupil Marisa didn't have any contact with her former master, pretty much like our Alice. There is only one person left, whose location we can confirm - Yuuka. An ominous flower lady living in a mansion called Mugenkan. Maybe she can clear things up regarding Reimu and Marisa?"

Yuuka was a little surprised to meet our mistress under these circumstances and apparently she denied any accusations of plundering our realm. Still she did make remarks about people we are interested in. Wonderful shrine maiden of paradise Reimu, ordinary magician Marisa and even our Alice - seven-colored puppeteer, she seems to know locations of them all. Both Alice and Marisa live now deep in a Forest of Magic in their own realm, while the new Hakurei Shrine is located somewhere to the south. Though at first we need to travel through the human lands, where the local population may be quite unfriendly towards demons, youkai and alike.

 MRY_control_of_the_tengu_mountains_desc:0 "The Youkai Mountain is a key location of Gensokyo. Not only has it tactical value but also high religion meaning for the Gensokyan and it is a perfect testing ground for the technology our realm brings from the modern world.

 MRY_the_other_side_of_the_mountain_desc:0 "Behind the Youkai Mountain Range there is an exclave of three goddesses in the Youkai Forest. The Aki sisters and Hina are deities for our rival religion.

We will show our superiority when we manage to get the judge of the dead to approve our ways!"

 MRY_human_world_title:0 "Convert the Humans"
 MRY_human_world_desc:0 "The goal of our conversions is not only to bring people to the true cause but also to gather their faith. And while youkais bring their fair amount of faith to Kanako, their contributions are peanuts compared to the faith humans bring. Sadly, the closest human settlings in our area serve hell and don't bring much faith. However, the humans from the Human Capital are a lot more profitable. It would be wise to conver these lost souls and collect their faith."

 MRY_organize_kappa_inventors_desc:0 "Kanako has great plans for Gensokyo and the life style on this land, but for this we need engineers, inventors and builders. Fortunately, our close neighbours, the kappas, are all this what we need. However, their skills truly shine as a team - which they cannot really organize by themselves.

 MRY_form_the_moriya_navy_desc:0 "The Hakurei Barrier has always been slightly broken - or else our realm wouldn't be in Gensokyo in the first place. But in recent times the cracks of the barrier have become far greater than ever before. It is obvious that the time of Gensokyan Isolation is over!

 MRY_establish_naval_supply_title:0 "Establish Naval Supply"

 MRY_back_to_japan_desc:0 "Japan is the land of our origin. It was these islands, where Kanako and Suwako fought with their kingdoms against eachother - the home of our Shrine Maiden Sanae Kochiya, a place of our heritage. Now it's a place of heretic Shintoism and civil wars with no ends. It is time for us to return and bring peace back to our ancient home."
 MRY_convert_japan_title:0 "Convert Japan"
 MRY_convert_japan_desc:0 "The history of Gensokyo is relatively young. Originally most of the inhabitants and even our religion are from our neighbour Japan, a country split in many small realms like ours. Much time has passed since then and the Japanese Shintoism and the Gensokyan Shintoism are now two completely different religions. Yet, if we show them the 'new' form of Shintoism, our Shintoism, they could save themself from their heresy."
 MRY_enlighten_korea_title:0 "Convert Korea"
 MRY_enlighten_korea_desc:0 "With the conversion of the heart of Japan our religious influence in Asia grew immensely. But we are not done yet!

 MRY_challenge_the_dragon_title:0 "Challenge the Dragon"
 MRY_challenge_the_dragon_desc:0 "Confucian is an interesting religion: it promotes humanistic ideas and tolerance and it is filled with ancient traditions. But it can also become a danger for any realm, because of these ideas and tradition the state gets slowed down and can't make fast decisions. This problem is currently the cause of the Celestial Empire's fighting. They are slowed in their actions, yet they are still holding on their outdated mindsets. We should challenge them and save them from themselves!"

 MRY_shinto_unites_far_eastern_asia_desc:0 "In the history of Asia, China, Korea and Japan have never had a good relation with each other and wars between these were more common than it should be.

Additionally, Marisa is eager to show Gensokyo her superiority in power over Reimu and while this is a commendable ambition, it is a troublesome when we need the Forest's help. Reimu needs to show her, that her skills are still unmatched!"
 HKR_build_shrine_prestige_title:0 "Restore Hakurei Prestige"
 HKR_build_shrine_prestige_desc:0 "With the break of the Hakurei Barrier as well as appearances of heretic religions, the Hakurei shrine maiden's authority has been questioned. Many people see Reimu as a lazy girl, who doesn't care for humanity's safety. Additionally, religious new-comer like Sanae, Byakuren and Miko are earning all the donations, which should be in Hakurei possession. To end this vicious cycle, we must show our capability and reliability-- at least on surface at the first step."

However, Sanae is a heretic and while their relationship isn't that bad, Sanae causes the lack of donators as her shrine gets all the people! She also showed great ambition to spread her religion to all of Gensokyo and challenges our status! We can't allow us to indulge her any more!"

Although they didn't show great desire to spread their faith, they still sought out after control of the capital.

However, times have changed and the Clan moved to the more fertile and strategical important south so the ressources were assured for a reformation of the Hakurei Shinto with the Danmaku system. But some people from the north didn't like this decision and remained \"Hakurei Traditional\" - lead by Meira, an old challenger of Reimu. Meira claimed to become the next, better Hakurei miko. We should teach her that a Hakurei miko's authority is not easily claimed!"

She tried to establish a new religion and to spread that to all Gensokyans. Although she is a goddess, we can't allow such actions. We have to shut her down and make sure no evil creature or mind will ever come out of Makai."
